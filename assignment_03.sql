-- Assignment 3-3: Processing Database Data with IF Statements
-- The Brewbeanâ€™s application needs a block to determine whether a customer is rated HIGH,
-- MID, or LOW based on his or her total purchases. The block needs to select the total amount of
-- orders for a specified customer, determine the rating, and then display the results onscreen. The
-- code rates the customer HIGH if total purchases are greater than $200, MID if greater than
-- $100, and LOW if $100 or lower. Use an initialized variable to provide the shopper ID.
-- 1. Start SQL Developer, if necessary.
-- 2. Open the assignment03-03.sql file from the Chapter03 folder. Review the partial block.
-- Edit the block to perform the required task.
-- 3. Run the block and verify the results. Enter and run the following SQL query to confirm that
-- the total for this shopper is indeed greater than $200:
-- SELECT SUM(total)
-- FROM bb_basket
-- WHERE idShopper = 22
-- AND orderplaced = 1
-- GROUP BY idshopper;
-- 4. Test other shoppers who have a completed order.
