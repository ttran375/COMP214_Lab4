-- Assignment 9-8: Maintaining an Audit Trail of Product Table Changes
-- The accuracy of product table data is critical, and the Brewbean’s owner wants to have an audit
-- file containing information on all DML activity on the BB_PRODUCT table. This information
-- should include the ID of the user performing the DML action, the date, the original values of the
-- changed row, and the new values. This audit table needs to track specific columns of concern,
-- including PRODUCTNAME, PRICE, SALESTART, SALEEND, and SALEPRICE. Create a table
-- named BB_PRODCHG_AUDIT to hold the relevant data, and then create a trigger named
-- BB_AUDIT_TRG that fires an update to this table whenever a specified column in the
-- BB_PRODUCT table changes.
-- TIP
-- Multiple columns can be listed in a trigger’s OF clause by separating them with commas.
-- Be sure to issue the following command. If you created the SALES_DATE_TRG trigger in the
-- chapter, it conflicts with this assignment.
-- ALTER TRIGGER sales_date_trg DISABLE;
-- Use the following UPDATE statement to test the trigger:
-- UPDATE bb_product
-- SET salestart = '05-MAY-2012',
-- saleend = '12-MAY-2012'
-- saleprice = 9
-- WHERE idProduct = 10;
-- When you’re finished, do a rollback and disable the trigger so that it doesn’t affect other
-- assignments.
