-- Assignment 7-11: Adding a Payment Retrieval Procedure to the Package
-- Modify the package created in Assignment 7-10 as follows:
-- • Add a new procedure named DD_PAYS_PP that retrieves donor pledge payment
-- information and returns all the required data via a single parameter.
-- • A donor ID is the input for the procedure.
-- • The procedure should retrieve the donor’s last name and each pledge payment
-- made so far (including payment amount and payment date).
-- • Make the procedure public.
-- Test the procedure with an anonymous block. The procedure call must handle the data
-- being returned by means of a single parameter in the procedure. For each pledge payment,
-- make sure the pledge ID, donor’s last name, pledge payment amount, and pledge payment
-- date are displayed.
-- Case Projects
-- Case 7-1: Reviewing Brewbean’s Order Checkout Package
-- In Chapter 6, you created a procedure and functions to handle updating basket columns during
-- the shopper checkout process. Create a package named SHOP_PROCESS_PKG that contains
-- all the program units created in Chapter 6. Modify the BASK_CALC_PP procedure so that the
-- subtotal, tax, shipping, and total amounts are placed in packaged variables rather than the
-- database so that the application can display a purchase confirmation page for shoppers.
-- Test this procedure with basket 3.
-- The lead programmer has requested that all package program units be in alphabetical order
-- to make them easy to locate. Use forward declarations, if needed, to allow alphabetizing
-- program units.
-- Case 7-2: Working with More Movies Program Unit Packaging
-- In the Chapter 5 More Movies case project, you created two procedures to support checking out
-- and checking in rented movies. In Chapter 6, you created a function for making inquiries about
-- movie availability. Create a package named MM_RENTALS_PKG to contain all these program
-- units, and make all the program units public. Test the MOVIE_INFO function with the movie
-- IDs 6 and 7.
