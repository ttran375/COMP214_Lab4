# Assignment 2-2: Creating a Flowchart 

The Brewbeanâ€™s application needs a block that determines whether a customer is rated high, mid, or low based on his or her total purchases. The block needs to determine the rating and then display the results onscreen. The code rates the customer high if total purchases are greater than $200, mid if greater than $100, and low if $100 or lower. Develop a flowchart to outline the conditional processing steps needed for this block.
