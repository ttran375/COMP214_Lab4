-- Case 7-1: Reviewing Brewbeanâ€™s Order Checkout Package
-- In Chapter 6, you created a procedure and functions to handle updating basket columns during
-- the shopper checkout process. Create a package named SHOP_PROCESS_PKG that contains
-- all the program units created in Chapter 6. Modify the BASK_CALC_PP procedure so that the
-- subtotal, tax, shipping, and total amounts are placed in packaged variables rather than the
-- database so that the application can display a purchase confirmation page for shoppers.
-- Test this procedure with basket 3.
-- The lead programmer has requested that all package program units be in alphabetical order
-- to make them easy to locate. Use forward declarations, if needed, to allow alphabetizing
-- program units.
-- Case 7-2: Working with More Movies Program Unit Packaging
-- In the Chapter 5 More Movies case project, you created two procedures to support checking out
-- and checking in rented movies. In Chapter 6, you created a function for making inquiries about
-- movie availability. Create a package named MM_RENTALS_PKG to contain all these program
-- units, and make all the program units public. Test the MOVIE_INFO function with the movie
-- IDs 6 and 7.
