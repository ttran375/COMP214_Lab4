-- Case 6-2: Working with More Movies Rentals
-- More Movies receives numerous requests to check whether movies are in stock. The company
-- needs a function that retrieves movie stock information and formats a clear message to display
-- to users requesting information. The display should resemble the following: “Star Wars is
-- Available: 11 on the shelf.”
-- Use movie ID as the input value for this function. Assume the MOVIE_QTY column in the
-- MM_MOVIES table indicates the number of movies currently available for checkout.
