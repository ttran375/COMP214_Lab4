-- Assignment 4-3: Using Implicit Cursors
-- The BB_SHOPPER table in the Brewbeanâ€™s database contains a column named PROMO that
-- specifies promotions to send to shoppers. This column needs to be cleared after the promotion
-- has been sent. First, open the assignment04-03.txt file in the Chapter04 folder in a text
-- editor (such as Notepad). Run the UPDATE and COMMIT statements at the top of this file (not
-- the anonymous block at the end). Modify the anonymous block so that it displays the number of
-- rows updated onscreen. Run the block.
UPDATE bb_shopper
SET
  promo = NULL;

UPDATE bb_shopper
SET
  promo = 'B'
WHERE
  idShopper IN (21, 23, 25);

UPDATE bb_shopper
SET
  promo = 'A'
WHERE
  idShopper = 22;

COMMIT;
