-- Assignment 7-9: Creating a Package for Pledges
-- Create a package named PLEDGE_PKG that includes two functions for determining dates of
-- pledge payments. Use or create the functions described in Chapter 6 for Assignments 6-12 and
-- 6-13, using the names DD_PAYDATE1_PF and DD_PAYEND_PF for these packaged functions.
-- Test both functions with a specific pledge ID, using an anonymous block. Then test both
-- functions in a single query showing all pledges and associated payment dates.
-- Assignment 7-10: Adding a Pledge Display Procedure to the Package
-- Modify the package created in Assignment 7-9 as follows:
-- • Add a procedure named DD_PLIST_PP that displays the donor name and all
-- associated pledges (including pledge ID, first payment due date, and last payment
-- due date). A donor ID is the input value for the procedure.
-- • Make the procedure public and the two functions private.
-- Test the procedure with an anonymous block.
-- Assignment 7-11: Adding a Payment Retrieval Procedure to the Package
-- Modify the package created in Assignment 7-10 as follows:
-- • Add a new procedure named DD_PAYS_PP that retrieves donor pledge payment
-- information and returns all the required data via a single parameter.
-- • A donor ID is the input for the procedure.
-- • The procedure should retrieve the donor’s last name and each pledge payment
-- made so far (including payment amount and payment date).
-- • Make the procedure public.
-- Test the procedure with an anonymous block. The procedure call must handle the data
-- being returned by means of a single parameter in the procedure. For each pledge payment,
-- make sure the pledge ID, donor’s last name, pledge payment amount, and pledge payment
-- date are displayed.
