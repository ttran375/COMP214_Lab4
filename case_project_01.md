# Case 3-1: Using Variable Types

The Brewbeanâ€™s manager has just hired another programmer to help you develop application
code for the online store. Explain the difference between scalar, record, and table variables to
the new employee.

1. **Scalar Variables:**
   - **Definition:** Scalar variables hold a single value of a specific data type.
   - **Example:** In your provided code, variables like `lv_ship_date`, `lv_shipper_txt`, `lv_ship_num`, and `lv_bask_num` are scalar variables.
   - **Usage:** Scalar variables are typically used to store individual data elements, such as numbers, strings, or dates.

2. **Record Variables:**
   - **Definition:** Record variables are used to store a collection of related data items as a single unit, similar to a row in a table.
   - **Example:** In your code, `rec_ship` is a record variable, storing multiple fields such as `dtstage`, `shipper`, and `shippingnum`.
   - **Usage:** Record variables are useful when you want to group related data together, and they often correspond to a row in a database table.

3. **Table Variables:**
   - **Definition:** Table variables hold a collection of data as if it were a small, in-memory table.
   - **Example:** In your code, you don't explicitly use table variables, but they would be useful if you needed to handle multiple rows of data, possibly from a result set or a set of records.
   - **Usage:** Table variables are beneficial when dealing with sets of related data, and they are often used to simplify operations on sets of rows.

**Summary:**

- **Scalar variables** are used for individual values.
- **Record variables** group related data together and are similar to a row in a table.
- **Table variables** are used to handle collections of data and are analogous to in-memory tables.

In the context of your Brewbean's application, scalar variables might be used for individual pieces of information (like a date or a quantity), record variables for groups of related data (like shipping information for an order), and table variables for handling sets of data (such as multiple orders or customer information).
