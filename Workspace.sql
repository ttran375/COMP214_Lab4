-- Assignment 7-2: Using Program Units in a Package
-- In this assignment, you use program units in a package created to store basket information. The
-- package contains a function that returns the recipientâ€™s name and a procedure that retrieves the
-- shopper ID and order date for a basket.
-- 1. In SQL Developer, create the ORDER_INFO_PKG package, using the
-- Assignment07-02.txt file in the Chapter07 folder. Review the code to become familiar
-- with the two program units in the package.
-- 2. Create an anonymous block that calls both the packaged procedure and function with
-- basket ID 12 to test these program units. Use DBMS_OUTPUT statements to display values
-- returned from the program units to verify the data.
-- 3. Also, test the packaged function by using it in a SELECT clause on the BB_BASKET table.
-- Use a WHERE clause to select only the basket 12 row.
