-- Assignment 7-8: Using a One-Time-Only Procedure in a Package
-- The Brewbeanâ€™s application currently contains a package used in the shopper logon process.
-- However, one of the developers wants to be able to reference the time users log on to
-- determine when the session should be timed out and entries rolled back. Modify the
-- LOGIN_PKG package (in the Assignment07-08.txt file in the Chapter07 folder). Use a
-- one-time-only procedure to populate a packaged variable with the date and time of user
-- logons. Use an anonymous block to verify that the one-time-only procedure works and
-- populates the packaged variable.
