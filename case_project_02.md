# Case 3-2: Working with More Movie Rentals

The More Movie Rental Company is developing an application page that displays the total
number of times a specified movie has been rented and the associated rental rating based on
this count. Table 3-4 shows the rental ratings.

Create a block that retrieves the movie title and rental count based on a movie ID provided
via an initialized variable. The block should display the movie title, rental count, and rental rating
on screen. Add exception handlers for errors you can and can’t anticipate. Run the block with
movie IDs of 4 and 25.

## TABLE 3-4 Movie Rental Ratings

| Number of Rentals | Rental Rating |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| Up to 5           | Dump          |
| 5–20              | Low           |
| 21–35             | Mid           |
| More than 35      | High          |
